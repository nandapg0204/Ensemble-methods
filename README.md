<h1> Ensemble methods </h1>


<p> Ensemble refers to group of models working together. Ensemble methods are the techniques to build a hybrid model by combining multiple models together.The intuition behind this approach is capitalize on individual models strengths while mitigating their weaknesses.Each model captures slightly different aspect of data making an ensemble more robust. Ensemble methods often perform better compared to indivisual models. The results from all the models in the ensemble are aggregated to form the final result. In classification tasks class with highest voting is predicted as final result where as in regression tasks average of all the results is predicted as final result</p>
